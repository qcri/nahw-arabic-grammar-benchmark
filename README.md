# Nahw: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Arabic Grammar Understanding, Error Detection, Correction, and Explanation
Nahw is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Arabic grammar understanding in large language models. It includes multiple-choice grammar questions (Nahw-MCQ), annotated passages for grammatical error detection, correction, and explanation (Nahw-Passage), and synthetic training data.

The benchmark covers theoretical and practical grammar knowledge in Modern Standard Arabic, supporting research on grammatical reasoning, error analysis, and educational NLP applications.
